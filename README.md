# julia-resources

People (mostly economists) often ask me for resources for learning Julia. Henceforth, I will simply direct you to this repo. 


I have found the following resources to be very helpful: 


- https://julia.quantecon.org/index_toc.html for getting set up and an intro to how packages work
  - See especially "Getting Started with Julia" and Packages and "Software Engineering in Julia". These sections are helpful for setting up your basic computing environment.

- https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/ (for basic syntax)

- https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/

- https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/ The Julia Docs are heavy on jargon, but maximally precise and pretty helpful: 

- Individual package docs (especially for the heavily-used packages) are very helpful

- The Julia version of StackExchange is https://discourse.julialang.org/. 

- Here is a long list of additional resources (videos,etc): https://julialang.org/learning/

In March 2017, QuantEcon generously invited me to help out with some workshops on Julia at the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (see https://github.com/QuantEcon/RBA_RBNZ_Workshops). Be warned: these workshops were conducted when the latest and greatest version of Julia was v0.5, so some of the syntax is badly out of date.
